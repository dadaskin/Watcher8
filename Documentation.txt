Watcher8 Documentation 
----------------------
04-Dec-2021

Here's the situation:
The last time I made a change to Watcher was 27-Jan-2019.
Up until this week it was working as intended.
But around 01-Dec, give or take a day, I noticed tha that the "Daily % change" column was always showing "0.0%"
for all symbols on both the Owned and Watch tabs.

I thought that maybe Yahoo finance had changed the format of the HTML again.
Luckily, the last time around I figured out to adapt to this situation.
The specific strings used to parse the YAHOO finance HTML are stored in the
Internal storage >> Ringtones >> Watcher8_Parser JSON file.

This way, when YAHOO changes the format, I can change figure out the change
and change the Parser string and we're back in business in about an hour.

So when I noticed the problem I dug in and, sure enought the string for PrevStart and PrevStop.
I found the correct strings and put them into the Watcher8_Parser file, but the problem persisted.

Is the parser code not working or is it something else?

I noticed that the Analyst opinion field was working, so I swapped the parser strings for that
and now the Prev Close number is displayed in the Analyst opinion spot, formatted as an analyst opinion.

This tells me that the parser is working properly to pull this number out or the HTML, but 
something else is preventing it from being displayed correctly.

I have the source code (in git and another copy on my hard drive) so I can try to figure out what is happening.
Utilities\Parser.java: Parser.parseYAHOOResponse()
   - Calls LoadStrings() to load the strings from the JSON file.
   - the PrevClose section uses the generalMid string.  <-- This might be the problem. 
   - the AnalystOpinion section doesn't   
          Trace through this.

Yes!  This was the problem.
And as it turns out I can fix it without changing the code.

The pattern we need to match in the HTML is:
"prevStart" followed, at some point, by "generalMid",
followed immediately by the value that is sought, 
followed immediately by "prevStop"

And there is a unique pattern like this!

Here's the working Watcher8_Parser file:
{
    "invalidSymbolMarker" : "content=\"Symbol Lookup from Yahoo Finance\"",
    "nameStartA" : "Lh(18px)\" data-reactid=\"7\">",
    "nameMidA" : " - ",
    "nameEnd1" : "<",
    "nameStartB" : "content=\"",
    "nameMidB" : ", ",
    "nameEnd2" : ", ",
    "ppsStart" : "\"regularMarketPrice\":{\"raw\":",
    "midPattern" : ",\"fmt\":\"",
    "stopPattern" : "\"}",
    "divStart" : "\"dividendRate\":{\"raw\":",
    "yrStart" : "FIFTY_TWO_WK_RANGE-value",
    "generalMid" :">",
    "yrStop" : "</td>",
    "analStart" : "\"recommendationMean\":{\"raw\":",
    "analStop" : ",\"fmt\"",
    "prevStart" : "data-test=\"PREV_CLOSE-value\" data-reactid=\"",
    "prevStop" : "</td>"
}

I am a software God!

They changed it again!

This time I took a clue from QuoteGrabber:
{
    "invalidSymbolMarker" : "content=\"Symbol Lookup from Yahoo Finance\"",
    "nameStartA" : "Lh(18px)\" data-reactid=\"7\">",
    "nameMidA" : " - ",
    "nameEnd1" : "<",
    "nameStartB" : "content=\"",
    "nameMidB" : ", ",
    "nameEnd2" : ", ",
    "ppsStart" : "\"qsp-price\" data-field=\"regularMarketPrice\"",
    "midPattern" : "value=\"",
    "stopPattern" : "\"",
    "divStart" : "\"dividendRate\":{\"raw\":",
    "yrStart" : "FIFTY_TWO_WK_RANGE-value",
    "generalMid" :">",
    "yrStop" : "</td>",
    "analStart" : "\"recommendationMean\":{\"raw\":",
    "analStop" : ",\"fmt\"",
    "prevStart" : "data-test=\"PREV_CLOSE-value\"",
    "prevStop" : "</td>"
}	

This changed the midPattern and stopPattern.
   PPS        OK
   Dividend    x
   Yr Range   OK
   Analyst    OK
   Prev Close OK
   
I tried changing the dividend string to be the same as QuoteGrabber, but it didn't work.   
   
I'm going to have to dig into the Android Studio again and change how the dividend is parsed out.

It's been over 3 years since I've had to do that.

Found some of the old documentation in D:\Watcher8\StockWatcher notes.txt

As of 15-Jul-2018 I was supporting API 25 <=> Android 7.1.1 (Nougat)

Emuulator: 
   Tools >> AVD Manager >> "Create Virtual Device" >> "New Hardware Profile"
   From: https://developer.samsung.com/galaxy-emulator-skin/galaxy-s.html?download=/emulatorskin/file/b85f61ee-60a4-4003-95b0-f691afc96387
   
   Screen size: 5.8"
   Resolution: 1440 x 2960  px
   Currently the phone has Android 9 (API 28) installed
   
   
App bulids and Emulator works! 
  Entered some stock symbols and info by hand.
  Chose "Export JSON" from Hamburger (aka "Action Bar") menu.

On AndroidStudio:
     View >> Tool Windows >> Device File Explorer.
	 This brings up a view of the Emulated device's file system.
	 
	 
On existing app on the phone the JSON app is stored in:
  Internal Storage >> Ringtones
This corresponds to:
  storage >> emulated >> 0 >> Ringtones 
     in Device File Explorer.
and
C:\Users\david\AppData\Local\Google\AndroidStudio2020.3\device-explorer\GalaxyS8_API_28 [emulator-5554]\storage\emulated\0\Ringtones	
    on my computer's file system.

To add a file from the computer to the emulator's file system:
    Select the destination folder in Device File Explorer,
	Right-click >> "Upload"
	Navigate to source folder and click on file.
    
Uploaded the JSON file with all my current portfolio to the Emulator!

Now: Can I get it to make the web request?
	I select one symbol and click the refresh button.
	I can't tell if anything worked or not, since the market is not open now.
	
I can emulate connecting to WiFi on the emulator, in almost the same way
I would do it on a real device.

Can I do something on the Emulated App and hit a breakpoint in the code?
  Yes!  (Just make sure to "Debug" the App, rather than "Run" it)
  
views\GenericDetailsActivity.detailsRefreshBNuttonClicked()
   calls utilities\Refresher.refreshSingle()
     which calls doSingleWebRequest()
   
I can get a web response from the debugger!
I'm in business!


16-Mar-2022:
------------
After much struggle I have put a unit test around parseYAHOOResponse()
so I can test it repeatably.

Next Step: Refactor this method
Then: Find a more robust way to do the parsing.


28-Mar-2022:
------------
Deployed as v1.2.0 today.

Seems to work OK. 
And Dividend shows up!

Checked-in and pushed.


07-Nov-2022:
-------------
About 2 weeks ago the app stopped working properly. 
I would not refresh all the quotes, and it would only do single refresh for some entries.

I ran the app in Android Studio and discovered that some of the URLs for some stocks were
returning 404.  A quick Google search turned up:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68259148/getting-404-error-for-certain-stocks-and-pages-on-yahoo-finance-python
and
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17049473/how-to-set-custom-header-in-volley-request

Apparently I have to include some code to make the app look like a browser.
Someone at Yahoo Finance must have just changed things to check for this.

All I had to do was add "User-Agent", "Mozilla/5.0" and as headers and it all worked!

Incremented version to 1.3.0  with today's date.


14-Jan-2024:
------------
My old phone (Samung GalaxyS8 SM-G950U GalaxyS8_API_28  Android 9) died on 27-Dec-2023.
I managed to save Watcher8_231209... and Watcher8_Parser a few weeks before the crash, 
so reloading the data shouldn't be too difficult.

I got a new phone:
   Model:           Samsung Galaxy S23 SM-S911U
   One UI Version:  6.0 
   Android Version: 14


Everything is up to date in GitHub with the last change shown above.
Now I'm ready to get Watcher 8 ready and deployed on the new version.

√ Create a new branch: S23 from master.
√ Start AndroidStudio and do any absolutely necessary updates.
  - AS update manager tells me that the latest update is not compatible with the Kotlin plugin.
    Don't do any updates at this point.
	
√ Try to get v1.3.0 working with the S8 emulator.
  - Tools >> AVD Manager  Click green arrow in "Galaxy S8 API 28" to start emulator. 
√ Figure out how to copy exported files to Emulator
  √ See line 134 above.
  
√ Get AS to connect to new phone via USB-C.
     On Phone: Settings  search for "Developer"  
	      Takes me to "Accessability" with "Developer settings" entry >> Developer setings
		  No settings that seem to be related to Connecting to AS.

    https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options	  
	Settings >> About Phone >> Build Number   tap "Build Number" 7 times to enter developer mode.
	Now Settings has a "Developer options" entry.
	"USB Debugging"  >> "Always allow from this computer"  
	
	And now the Phone's Device File Explorer shows up in AS!
	  json files are already on the new device
  
√ Try to download this to the new phone as is.
    x Figure out how to copy the Exported files to the new phone.
	x Import the files on the new phone.
	√ On AS: Run >> Run app..
	  App appears on phone and will get updated PPS info 
	  
Now all I need to do is update the info in the App since 09-Dec-2023.
	

15-Jun-2024:
--------------
Watcher hasn't been working properly since the middle of April.
Maybe just a change of parser strings.



Current Parser strings: (dated 12/27/2023)
{
    "invalidSymbolMarker" : "content=\"Symbol Lookup from Yahoo Finance\"",
    "nameStart" : "content=\"",
    "nameMid" : ", ",
    "nameOffset" : 0,
    "nameStop" :  ", ",
    "ppsStart" : "\"qsp-price\" data-field=\"regularMarketPrice\"",
    "ppsMid" :  "value=\"",
    "ppsOffset" : 0,
    "ppsStop" : "\"",
    "divStart" : "DIVIDEND_AND_YIELD-value\">",
    "divMid" : "",
    "divOffset" : 0,
    "divStop" : " (",
    "yrStart" : "FIFTY_TWO_WK_RANGE-value",
    "yrMid" : ">",
    "yrOffset" : 0,
    "yrStop" :  "</td>",
    "analStart" : "ONE_YEAR_TARGET_PRICE-value\">",
    "analMid" : "",
    "analOffset" : 0,
    "analStop" : "<",
    "prevStart" : "data-test=\"PREV_CLOSE-value\">",
    "prevMid" : "",
    "prevOffset" : 0,
    "prevStop" : "</td>"
}	


for 14-Jun-2024:
                GOGL			PRWCX			QYLD				AEP					VZ
Name:           Golden Ocean 	T. Rowe Price	Global X NASDAQ		American Electric   
PPS (Close):	12.85			36.11			17.80				88.00				39.67
Div: 			0.80			 n/a			 n/a				3.52
Yr Range: 		6.89-15.77  	 n/a			16.25-18.16			69.38-93.44
Opinion: 		2.4			 	 n/a			 n/a				2.7
1 yr target: 	170.7 (?)	 	 n/a			 n/a				90.11
                15.89
Prev Close: 	13.41			36.12 			17.80 				87.90				39.78
                 -4.2%           0.0%            0.0%                0.1%				-0.3%	

It looks like the current parser strings will work, but the parser is expecting them to be in order.
This appears to no longer be the case.  The same strings work but the "FIFTY_TWO_WK_RANGE-value" now appears
before "DIVIDEND_AND_YIELD-value\" in the html.

Thus I will need to change the actual code to examine the whole html for each piece of data, 
instead of allowing it to progress through the html.

Checking with PRWCX.   Name doesn't seem to work anymore (although the actual app on the phone gets this 
information properly).

Check with QYLD:  Name: OK, PPS: OK, Prev Close: OK  (all in order since we're not looking for the others)

Check with AEP: All OK.

Note: It seems that "nameStart" string in the parser strings file has the symbol appended to it in the Parser.


I'll dig into the parser another day.


16-Jun-2024:
------------
The Emulator shows that same symptoms as the deployed version.

In app >> java >> com.adaskin.android.watcher8 >> utilities >> Parsers.java
Method: parseDividend()
put a break point on line 162.

It looks like the parser already checks through the whole htmlResponse for each piece.
How to "Step over" while debugging in AndroidStudio? f8

Looks like the html that gets sent to cell phone is significantly different that what gets sent to a computer.
Yesterday, I was looking at the computer version.

To debug the parser strings I need to add code to the end of Parsers.LoadStrings().

Things to check:
1. DONE Make Div, Yr Range, Target, today % change work for all symbols. 
     -     Move parser string changes from code to file. 
	 -     Change version numbers and strings.
     -     Check-in 
     -     Deploy to phone.	 
2.      Change "Analysts' Opinion:"  field name to:
               "Analysts' Target:"
3.      Change Target field display format to same as PPS format.
4.      Increase width of Total Investment value field so O shows properly
5.      Make Watch view scroll like Owned view.
6.      Add "Current Value:" field to show PPS*(Sum(NumShares for each block))


Changes:
1. Change Parser strings as follows:
        mParserStrings.divStart = "Forward Dividend &amp; Yield</span> <span";
        mParserStrings.divMid = "\">";

        mParserStrings.yrStart = "52 Week Range</span> <span";
        mParserStrings.yrMid = "data-value=\"";
        mParserStrings.yrStop = "\" ";

        mParserStrings.analStart = "1y Target Est</span> <span";
        mParserStrings.analMid = "data-value=\"";
        mParserStrings.analStop = "\" ";

        mParserStrings.prevStart = "Previous Close</span> <span";
        mParserStrings.prevMid = "data-value=\"";
        mParserStrings.prevStop = "\" ";		
	
2.  Change Parser.parseAnalysisOpinion() to use analMid parser string.


07-Jul-2024:
------------
I got to step 1 above	(line 348) and it didn't work.

I've got to drop back to the current version code in Git and start from scratch.

DONE Install Emulator for a Galaxy S23 phone.  I don't think that the emulator for the old s8 (pre-Dec'23) is
accurately reflecting what's going on.

I downloaded the skins for Galaxy_S23 from Samsung's website.
The installation/use instructions didn't match my current version of AndroidStudio, so I did the best I could:

AS MainMenu >> Tools >> AVD Manager, "+ Create Virtual Device"
I looked up the screen size (6.3") and resolution (1080 x 2340, xxhdpi)
 (Note: this is less than the resolution I had for the S8 AVD: 1440x2960, xxxhdpi)
 
Copied the downloaded skins to  C:\Users\david\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\skins\Galaxy_23\
Choose this folder name from the AVD >> edit >> "Show Advanced Settings" >> "Custom skin definition" dropdown.

This appears to work.  The AVD runs and produces something that looks like my phone's display.

Where do we put the Parser string file and the saved JSON file?
  The app won't work properly without them and doesn't error out properly.
  
Where in the AS display of the Emulator file system, is the RINGTONES folder?
